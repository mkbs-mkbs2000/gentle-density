{#if selectedProvince === "British Columbia"}

	<p>
		British Columbia (BC) is Canada’s westernmost province, reaching 1,200 km north to south and 1,050km from east to west. The province is home to 5.65 million people and of that, 5.4% are cultural workers making BC home to the largest population of cultural workers in Canada.  
	</p>
	<p>
		BC is currently suffering from a housing crisis with the <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/vancouver-renters-half-salary-rental-costs-royal-lepage#:~:text=Twenty%2Dthree%20per%20cent%20of,the%20high%20cost%20of%20living." target="_blank">Vancouver Sun</a> reporting that 23% of renters spend more than 30% on housing and 42% spend more than 50% of their net income on housing. To combat the lack of affordable housing options, the province has created a new <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/housing-and-tenancy/tools-for-government/local-governments-and-housing/ssmuh_provincial_policy_manual.pdf" target="_blank"> Policy Manual & Site Standards for Small-Scale, Multi-Unit Housing</a> (SSMUH).  Under the policy, SSMUH includes secondary suites, ADU’s, triplexes, townhomes, and house-plexes. Through the development of these housing types, the province hopes to provide more housing options for low to middle-income families, for aging parents, adult children or other family members, helping to pay a mortgage or investing in existing property and contributing to more long-term rental housing in communities.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Secondary Suites under BC legislation is defined as an independent living unit with its own kitchen, sleeping area, and washroom facilities contained within another dwelling. An ADU is defined as a self-contained dwelling unit, such as a garden suite, laneway home, carriage house or garage suite, located on the same legal lot as another dwelling. 
	</p>
	<p>
		All policies and procedures for the construction of a secondary suite or ADU can be found in the Home Suite <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/housing-and-tenancy/building-or-renovating/secondary-suites/home-suite-home-2023-sept-6.pdf" target="_blank">Home: Guidelines on How to Add and Manage a Secondary Suite or Accessory Dwelling Unit in British Columbia</a>.   
	</p>
	<p>
		In the report, funding for secondary suites and ADU’s is discussed as attainable through the <a href="https://www.bchousing.org/housing-assistance/secondary-suite" target="_blank">Secondary Suite Incentive Program</a> (SSIP). The SSIP provides financial assistance to homeowners who wish to build long-term affordable rental units. Homeowners can receive up to 50% on the cost of renovations, up to a maximum of $40,000. Money is given through a rebate in the form of loan does not to be repaid if the homeowner follows the terms of the program.

{:else if selectedProvince === "Alberta"}

	<p>
		Alberta is the fourth largest province in Canada, covering 661,848 km2 in land area. The current population of the province as of 2024 is 4.85 million. The province additionally in 2024, registered the largest net inflow of interprovincial migrants in Canada.  
	</p>
	<p>
		The province of Alberta takes pride in the fact that families living in its grasp have access to lower housing costs, with a home costing as little as $450,000. Despite this claim, almost 500,000 people in Alberta pay more than 30% on housing. According to <a href="https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/d17f3af6-fa5a-4cb0-b36e-248823cddff1/resource/d11b4795-763a-4221-b6f9-2f5769df50a5/download/sh-stronger-foundations-albertas-10-year-strategy-affordable-housing-2021.pdf" target="_blank">Alberta’s 10-year strategy to improve and expand affordable housing</a>, the province’s social and affordable housing represents 3.1% of the total housing stock, which is below the national average.
	</p>
	<p>
		According to Alberta’s <a href="https://ebs.safetycodes.ab.ca/documents/webdocs/PI/safety-tips_secondary-suites_april2021.pdf" target="_blank">Secondary Suites Standards</a>, a secondary suite is defined as a self-contained dwelling unit that is part of a house containing not more than two dwelling units (including the secondary suite). A secondary suite may have more than one storey and be either on the same level, above or below the principal dwelling. Permitted secondary suites include individual detached houses, semi-detached houses (half of a double) and freehold row houses. Secondary suites are also permitted where they are in a portion of a building. The province makes it clear that each municipality has different land use bylaws concerning secondary suites and if a resident wishes to build one, they should consult their local municipal bylaws.
	</p>
	<p>
		Secondary suites must include a kitchen, bathroom, and a separate entrance. They also must have their own independent heating and ventilation system as per the National Building Code. Funding for secondary suites is administered through the individual municipalities, but the province does have an <a href="https://www.alberta.ca/affordable-housing-partnership-program#jumplinks-1" target="_blank">Affordable Housing Partnership Program</a>. The program allows public, non-profit, and private-sector housing providers to apply for funding. Under construction type eligibility, it allows for an addition to or renovation of existing housing resulting in a minimum 5 net new affordable housing units, conversion of non-rental housing (for example, hotel or commercial space), redevelopment on the existing site involving demolition and new construction and resulting in a minimum of 5 net new affordable housing units, and new construction.

{:else if selectedProvince === "Saskatchewan"}

	<p>
		Saskatchewan (SK) is a province in central Canada with a population of 1.13 million. It is the fourth largest province in the country with an area of 577,060 sq km. More than half of the population lives outside the four largest cities. This population is widely dispersed throughout the province and includes remote, rural, and northern communities.vi It is estimated that more than 41,8005 Saskatchewan households continue to be in core housing need which include seniors and Indigenous households. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Saskatchewan Housing Corporation (SHC) is a Treasury Board Crown Corporation responsible for housing policy, programs and services in the province. In 2019, the SHC entered into a 10-year, cost-matched funding agreement with the CMHC under the National Housing Strategy. The Saskatchewan Housing Action Plan 2022-25 will invest approximately $585 million of provincial and federal funding to protect, renew and expand community housing and support Saskatchewan’s priorities related to housing repair, construction and affordability. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Over the past three years, availability of rental units in the private market has decreased as the province’s population has increased to record gains and opportunities for home ownership have tightened with rising interest rates. The <a href="https://www.saskatchewan.ca/residents/taxes-and-investments/tax-credits/saskatchewan-secondary-suite-incentive-grant-program" target="_blank">Secondary Suite Incentive (SSI)</a> grant program is designed to increase the availability of rental units in their communities, improve housing affordability and generate supplementary income for homeowners. The grant program will provide 35 per cent of the total price to construct a new secondary suite within an owner’s primary residence (or a laneway home, garden suite, or garage suite), to a maximum of $35,000 for a qualifying suite. The program comes with its eligibility criteria and timeline.

{:else if selectedProvince === "Manitoba"}

	<p>
		Manitoba (MB) is one of the Prairie Provinces of Canada, lying midway between the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. It has a population of 1.34 million people covering 540,310 square kilometers, making it the fifth-largest province in the country. In the last decade, international immigration has strongly contributed to Manitoba’s population growth. International immigration is likely to continue to have a strong influence on rental housing demand, as recent arrivals to the province tend to rent first before buying homes. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="http://www.manitoba.mb.ca/housing/index.html" target="_blank">Manitoba Housing</a> is a Crown Corporation created in 1967. It is mandated to enhance the affordability of, and accessibility to, adequate housing for Manitobans, particularly those of low to moderate incomes or those with specialized needs; maintain and improve the condition of existing housing stock; ensure there is an adequate supply of housing stock in Manitoba; and stimulate the activities of the housing market to the benefit of Manitobans as a whole. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Since 2010, the province has been encouraging the construction of secondary suites, or granny suites, in homes to deal with the province's housing needs and help to build healthy, vibrant communities. The province explains secondary suites as “in essence, a rental apartment located on a property that would normally accommodate only a single-family home.” <a href="https://www.manitoba.ca/mr/land_use_dev/pubs/mpgss.pdf" target="_blank">Although undocumented, a high number of illegal, do-it-yourself, secondary suites are suspected to exist in municipalities throughout Manitoba. The construction of legal secondary suites through municipal development and permitting processes has not been common in Manitoba. The reason could be that most of the municipal development plan and zoning bylaws do not contain policies and regulations specifically allowing for secondary suites</a>. To combat this problem, in 2013 the province issued the <a href="https://www.manitoba.ca/mr/land_use_dev/pubs/mpgss.pdf" target="_blank">Municipal Planning Guidelines for Secondary Suites</a> to encourage Manitoba municipalities to allow secondary suites by adopting a less restrictive stance towards their development.

{:else if selectedProvince === "Ontario"}

	<p>
		Ontario (ON) is the second largest province in Canada, covering about 0.89 million square kilometers, and is the most populous province in the country with 14.22 million. It is one of the fastest growing places in North Americaii with a projected increase of 43.6 per cent between 2022 and 2046, that is, 6.6 million people over the next 24 years. Within the province, Central Ontario is projected to be the fastest growing region. As the population grows, the province must meet its housing requirements.  
	</p>
	<p>
		44.1% of all Canadian households that are in <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/document/ontarios-interim-action-plan-under-national-housing-strategy-2022-23/ontarios-context#section-1" target="_blank">core housing need</a> (a measure of housing affordability, suitability and adequacy) are in Ontario, the highest in the country. Though it must be noted that Ontario receives about 39% of funding from the federal government.  Ontario set a goal of building at least 1.5 million new homes by 2031 and is committed to meeting this goal in part by “promoting building up near transit and reforming zoning to create more ‘gentle density’” (Ontario 2019). The province has also set housing targets for Ontario’s 50 largest municipalities, 19 of which reached or exceeded their goals for 2023. Municipalities are incentivized through the Building Faster Fund, a $1.2 billion fund that provides up to $400 million per year to reward municipalities that have achieved at least 80% of their annual target, with a bonus for those exceeding their annual goals (CBRE, 2024).    
	</p>
	<p>
		In 2023, Ontario recorded 9,879 additional residential unit starts. To encourage their development, Ontario presents a dedicated webpage for adding a second unit. To further incentivize the developments, Ontario does not collect development charges for secondary suites and offers forgivable loans to homeowners under Ontario Renovates Secondary Suites Program. The province makes it clear that each municipality has different land use bylaws concerning secondary suites and if a resident wishes to build one, they should consult their local municipal bylaws.

		New Brunswick (NB) is one of Canada's eastern provinces, located in the region known as the Maritime Provinces. It is Canada’s only officially bilingual province, with French and English having equal status with a population of 775,610 and land area of over 70,000 square kilometres. Over the last decade, particularly in the past five years, New Brunswick has experienced record setting population growth after years of decline and stagnation.  
	</p>
	<p>
		The province also recognizes changing housing preferences, lack of supply to meet demand, labor shortages and market pressures as factors that influence their housing situation. In 2023 through a series of stakeholder consultation, NB released a strategy Housing for All that promised to create the conditions to develop 6,000 new homes per year.

{:else if selectedProvince === "Nova Scotia"}

	<p>
		Nova Scotia (NS) is the second smallest province in Canada, covering about 55,284 square kilometers and population under a million. The recent significant growth in the province puts pressure on its housing market. The growing population and housing supply shortage is most prominent in Halifax Regional Municipality but is also impacting all other regions of the province. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The 2022Provincial Housing Needs Assessment Report estimated that given various key indicators, including demographic predictions, the province has a current gap between housing supply and demand of 27,300 units and that is expected to grow to 71,600 units by 2027.iv In October 2023, the government released its five-year housing plan – <a href="https://novascotia.ca/action-for-housing/" target="_blank">Our Homes, Action for Housing</a>. The plan represents a projected $1-billion investment and highlights targets to create the conditions for more than 40,000 new housing units from one end of the province to the other. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Nova Scotia defines secondary and backyard suites as self-contained dwelling units located within or on the same property as an existing house (or main dwelling unit) and are registered under the same title. Piloted in 2023, the Province made an $8-million investment over three years for <a href="https://beta.novascotia.ca/documents/secondary-and-backyard-suite-incentive-program-guidelines" target="_blank">Secondary and Backyard Suite Incentive Program</a>. This program offers financial incentives to eligible homeowners who plan to build a housing unit within or on the property of their primary residence. Homeowners may receive up to 50% of the eligible project costs, to a maximum of $40,000. Homeowners that continue to live in their primary residence and meet the tenant eligibility requirements over the 5-year term of the loan do not need to repay the loan. As of April 2024, the Province had received more than 500 inquiries about the program, received 48 applications and approved 25 forgivable loans.v The homeowner and tenant eligibility criteria, eligible costs and process are outlined in <a href="https://beta.novascotia.ca/sites/default/files/documents/1-3589/secondary-and-backyard-suite-incentive-program-guide-en.pdf" target="_blank">this guide</a>.
