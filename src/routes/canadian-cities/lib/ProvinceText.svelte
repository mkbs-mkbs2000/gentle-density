{#if selectedProvince === "British Columbia"}

	<p>
		British Columbia (BC) is Canada’s westernmost province, reaching 1,200 km north to south and 1,050km from east to west. The province is home to 5.65 million people and of that, 5.4% are cultural workers making BC home to the largest population of cultural workers in Canada.  
	</p>
	<p>
		BC is currently suffering from a housing crisis with the <a href="https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/vancouver-renters-half-salary-rental-costs-royal-lepage#:~:text=Twenty%2Dthree%20per%20cent%20of,the%20high%20cost%20of%20living." target="_blank">Vancouver Sun</a> reporting that 23% of renters spend more than 30% on housing and 42% spend more than 50% of their net income on housing. To combat the lack of affordable housing options, the province has created a new <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/housing-and-tenancy/tools-for-government/local-governments-and-housing/ssmuh_provincial_policy_manual.pdf" target="_blank"> Policy Manual & Site Standards for Small-Scale, Multi-Unit Housing</a> (SSMUH).  Under the policy, SSMUH includes secondary suites, ADU’s, triplexes, townhomes, and house-plexes. Through the development of these housing types, the province hopes to provide more housing options for low to middle-income families, for aging parents, adult children or other family members, helping to pay a mortgage or investing in existing property and contributing to more long-term rental housing in communities.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Secondary Suites under BC legislation is defined as an independent living unit with its own kitchen, sleeping area, and washroom facilities contained within another dwelling. An ADU is defined as a self-contained dwelling unit, such as a garden suite, laneway home, carriage house or garage suite, located on the same legal lot as another dwelling. 
	</p>
	<p>
		All policies and procedures for the construction of a secondary suite or ADU can be found in the Home Suite <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/housing-and-tenancy/building-or-renovating/secondary-suites/home-suite-home-2023-sept-6.pdf" target="_blank">Home: Guidelines on How to Add and Manage a Secondary Suite or Accessory Dwelling Unit in British Columbia</a>.   
	</p>
	<p>
		In the report, funding for secondary suites and ADU’s is discussed as attainable through the <a href="https://www.bchousing.org/housing-assistance/secondary-suite" target="_blank">Secondary Suite Incentive Program</a> (SSIP). The SSIP provides financial assistance to homeowners who wish to build long-term affordable rental units. Homeowners can receive up to 50% on the cost of renovations, up to a maximum of $40,000. Money is given through a rebate in the form of loan does not to be repaid if the homeowner follows the terms of the program.

{:else if selectedProvince === "Alberta"}

	<p>
		Alberta is the fourth largest province in Canada, covering 661,848 km2 in land area. The current population of the province as of 2024 is 4.85 million. The province additionally in 2024, registered the largest net inflow of interprovincial migrants in Canada.  
	</p>
	<p>
		The province of Alberta takes pride in the fact that families living in its grasp have access to lower housing costs, with a home costing as little as $450,000. Despite this claim, almost 500,000 people in Alberta pay more than 30% on housing. According to <a href="https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/d17f3af6-fa5a-4cb0-b36e-248823cddff1/resource/d11b4795-763a-4221-b6f9-2f5769df50a5/download/sh-stronger-foundations-albertas-10-year-strategy-affordable-housing-2021.pdf" target="_blank">Alberta’s 10-year strategy to improve and expand affordable housing</a>, the province’s social and affordable housing represents 3.1% of the total housing stock, which is below the national average.
	</p>
	<p>
		According to Alberta’s <a href="https://ebs.safetycodes.ab.ca/documents/webdocs/PI/safety-tips_secondary-suites_april2021.pdf" target="_blank">Secondary Suites Standards</a>, a secondary suite is defined as a self-contained dwelling unit that is part of a house containing not more than two dwelling units (including the secondary suite). A secondary suite may have more than one storey and be either on the same level, above or below the principal dwelling. Permitted secondary suites include individual detached houses, semi-detached houses (half of a double) and freehold row houses. Secondary suites are also permitted where they are in a portion of a building. The province makes it clear that each municipality has different land use bylaws concerning secondary suites and if a resident wishes to build one, they should consult their local municipal bylaws.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Secondary suites must include a kitchen, bathroom, and a separate entrance. They also must have their own independent heating and ventilation system as per the National Building Code. Funding for secondary suites is administered through the individual municipalities, but the province does have an <a href="https://www.alberta.ca/affordable-housing-partnership-program#jumplinks-1" target="_blank">Affordable Housing Partnership Program</a>. The program allows public, non-profit, and private-sector housing providers to apply for funding. Under construction type eligibility, it allows for an addition to or renovation of existing housing resulting in a minimum 5 net new affordable housing units, conversion of non-rental housing (for example, hotel or commercial space), redevelopment on the existing site involving demolition and new construction and resulting in a minimum of 5 net new affordable housing units, and new construction.
